    "# AutoQuant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an example of how to use AIMET AutoQuant feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET offers a suite of neural network post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques that can be applied in succession. However, finding the right sequence of techniques to apply is time-consuming and can be challenging for non-expert users. We instead recommend AutoQuant to save time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoQuant is an API that analyzes the model and automatically applies various PTQ techniques based on best-practices heuristics. You specify a tolerable accuracy drop, and AutoQuant applies PTQ techniques cumulatively until the target accuracy is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This example performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define constants and helper functions\n",
    "2. Load a pretrained FP32 model\n",
    "3. Run AutoQuant\n",
